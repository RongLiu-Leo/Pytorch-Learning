# PyTorch Learning
 
- This repo goes through PyTorch fundamentals as detailed as possible for convenient review.
- The repo is code-oriented, and the codes are heavily based on the course [Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery book](https://www.learnpytorch.io/). For more code contents, the [PyTorch official document](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and the course are highly recommended. For more mathematical principles, the book, [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), is attractive.

## Content
The codes show up in interactive Jupyter Notebook format. The notebook format combines texts and codes and is convenient to run and debug the results.

The contents are divided into different parts, which contain [Notes](/Notes/) and [Exercises](/Exercises/).
- Each part highlights a specific domain of PyTorch. Hence this repo can be used as a PyTorch cheatsheet. 
- Moreover, hope that after going through these notebooks carefully, the whole landscape of PyTorch stays in the brain so this repo will never be used again.
